Software Engineer by day, cyclist & Calculus teacher by night. I build efficient solutions that empower millions, thriving on complex challenges tackled with logic and a dash of creativity. 

Quick thinking and quality decisions are my tools of the trade, keeping projects on track even in the fast-paced world of tech.

Off-screen, I push boundaries on the road and in the classroom, fostering values like teamwork and resilience that seamlessly translate into my code.
